<h2 id="the-secret-life-of-groceries">The Secret Life of Groceries</h2>
<p>I took months to finish this book — Not because it was a slog, but because I enjoyed it too much and didn&rsquo;t want to binge it all in one go! Isn&rsquo;t that wild?! The pandemic has made everyone keenly more aware of the systems that get food from the ground to our tables. <em>The Secret Life of Groceries</em> comes to pique those curiosities with in-depth looks into the system from the vantage point of the grocery store (<em>Our beloved Trader Joe&rsquo;s</em>), a food entrepreneur, a Thai shrimp farmer, and a truck driver.</p>
<h2 id="the-office-of-historical-corrections">The Office of Historical Corrections</h2>
<p>This series of short stories and novella felt like fresh air. Each story centers around microaggressions and perspectives from a Black woman&rsquo;s point of view. It&rsquo;s an important voice to be heard for this very reason, but her writing is sharp and dynamic as well. I couldn&rsquo;t stop reading it and felt excited about the magic of words for the first time in a while.</p>
<h2 id="convenience-store-woman">Convenience Store Woman</h2>
<p>The end of 2021 closed in and my reading pace dragged, so I took a chance on this extremely short (&lt; 150 pages) book. The tempo and tone of the book are jarring from the get-go. It&rsquo;s a character study, told from the first-person point of view of an emotionally detached woman in her mid-30s who works in a convenience store. She is curt and untraditional in her way of thinking.</p>
<h2 id="lurking-how-a-person-became-a-user">Lurking: How a Person Became a User</h2>
<h3 id="by-joanne-mcneil">by Joanne McNeil</h3>
<p>The best way to describe <em>Lurking</em> is a love letter and critical analysis of the social internet rolled up into a great book. I love learning about the history and sociology related to the internet, though books on the subject can always end up too technical/dry or fangirl/antagonistic about the topic to be taken seriously. McNeil&rsquo;s familiarity with tech as a millennial who grew up with it and a technologist who engages with it as a tool (She has taught at the School of Poetic Computation) hits the sweet spot in this deep dive. She covers message boards, live streaming, social networking, and cleverly, Wikipedia (*spoiler alert*). Framing Wikipedia as the only true commons of the internet with a larger community of readers and smaller community of editors demonstrates the kind of clever thinking that makes this such a good read.</p>
<h2 id="cook-real-hawaii">Cook Real Hawaii</h2>
<p><em>Top Chef</em> to me, is what the <em>Office</em> or <em>Law and Order: SVU</em> is for many other people. I love this show. I watch it non-stop. That said, I&rsquo;ve never bothered checking out books by any of the cheftestants, since their food is so beyond my everyday fare. <em>Cook Real Hawaii</em> lands right on the bullseye though — Local food x Top Chef. Sheldon Simeon repped Hawaii proudly throughout his two stints on the show, so I knew his book would be delicious yet unapologetically local. The recipes cover the whole gamut of local dishes, with plenty of color text to bring readers into the local culture that comes with the dishes. It&rsquo;s amazing to see all the color and flavor of local culture on a national stage through this book.</p>
<p>Note: I&rsquo;ve only made two recipes from this book so far — the pan sushi dynamic is a go-to group dish in my book! It&rsquo;s a little harder to make the other dishes without a whole family to eat it with me.</p>
