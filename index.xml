      <description>The world of craft beer today is colorful, fun, and incredibly expressive. It&amp;rsquo;s also flavorful, but as someone who does not enjoy beer, the cans always appealed to me visually above anything else.
Looks like Art, Tastes like Feet is a study on craft beer can artwork, memorializing the beer can collection of the unofficial Grand Somerville Beer Can Art Gallery. Three different typefaces tango together throughout the publication to capture craft beer culture&amp;rsquo;s quirkiness, craft, and casualness.</description>

      <title>Kilachand Honors College Symposium poster</title>
      <link>https://tiffanylo.info/projects/khc-symposium/</link>

      <description>Every year, the Boston Univeristy Kilachand Honors College hosts a symposium where graduating seniors present their keystone projects across academic disciplines to the greater BU community. At the heart of the Kilachand Honors College program is the mission of fostering interdisciplinary thinking led by the heart and mind, to embody the idea of &amp;ldquo;Only connect&amp;rdquo; as described in E.M. Forster&amp;rsquo;s Howard&amp;rsquo;s End. Keystone projects ranged from analyses of operating room efficiencies to the history and influence of loanwords on the Japanese language to the impact of hegemonic masculinity on male fashion.</description>

      <title>Boston University Women in Computer Science (WiCS) Branding</title>

      <description>BU WiCS is an organization focused on fostering a sense of community and empowering students in the BU Computer Science department, with a focus on female students who have historically been significantly out-numbered in the department.
Prior logos emphasized the technical nature of the organization, but the board members wanted new branding that felt more inviting, more engaging, and more memorable.
The use of a monoline script BU WiCS wordmark conveys the friendliness and personal nature of the group.</description>

      <title>Meringue</title>

      <description>Meringue captures all the delight and swoopiness of cake lettering, packaged into a neat display typeface. It has generous curves and spacing, with minimal overlaps, as a nod to the constraints posed by frosting as a substrate and a piping bag as a writing tool. Think wide letters for easier handling, minimal stroke overlaps to decrease areas with too much frosting, broad curves made by physically moving the arm/body, and a tail formed by a baker pulling the piping bag up and away upon finishing a letter.</description>

      <title>Um, Berella</title>

      <description>Um, Berella is a flared serif typeface family inspired by the style, attitude, and vision of Rihanna — global pop sensation, style and cultural icon, entrepreneur, and designer. Its snatched waists, accentuated curves, assertive joins, and tension between its outer curvature and inner obtuse angles borrow the common tropes exhibited by Rihanna&amp;rsquo;s design preferences. The geometry involves pointed shapes, but rarely uses boring right angles and triangles. The features are drawn decisively and full of attention to construction, with no frilliness or extraneousness.</description>

      <title>Celebrate the Mini Wins in Life</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Celebrate the Mini Wins in Life!&amp;rdquo; is a personal mantra that I keep to remain thankful and optimistic despite the demands of everyday life. This poster is a party with vibrant colors, bold typography, and enough confetti to last all night long. Everything was hand-cut and drawn with love and care. It was an extremely time-consuming process. However, it was great fun to return to my papercraft roots and experiment organically throughout the design iterations.</description>

      <title>Music &#43; Us</title>

      <description>Music + Us explores how we can use the lens of music and self-quantification to make data feel human in a world where big data continues to grow and data feels increasingly abstract, impersonal, and even daunting to the average individual.
The project aimed to inform audiences about data visualization history and literacy, followed by applying that understanding to music listening data collected through a survey, Billboard Hot 100 music data, and available music metadata.</description>

      <title>26 Days of Type</title>

      <description>Every year, folks around the world participate in the 36 Days of Type project in the Spring and share in the love of letterforms.
Each letter is inspired by the work of an artist whose name started with the letter — It was a playground for testing out letterforms and adapting different visual styles to my own sensibilities.</description>

      <description>Begin Anywhere. A simple mantra that’s much harder to put into practice.
Rather than approaching the poster design on Illustrator or with ink + paper, I decided to open myself up to a new medium/approach — A ball of yarn and a large blank poster board to design on.</description>

      <title>Home Wiz</title>

      <guid>https://tiffanylo.info/projects/home-wiz/</guid>
      <description>Home Wiz is a local handyman business that wanted to present their company as approachable, reliable, and trustworthy. Their previous logo missed the mark with its sleepy wizard in pajamas and skinny typeface selection.
Raf loved the idea of incorporating the shape of a house roof in the crossbar of the H, but as I explored this idea with existing typefaces, it was clear why this is not a common form in other typefaces.</description>
