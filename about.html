				<p>Hi there! I'm Tiffany - a developer, designer, and tinkerer, currently studying Computer Science and Graphic Design at Boston University.</p>
<p>Nothing excites me quite like breaking down a challenging problem and devising a clever and beautiful solution for it. It’s such a rewarding experience. I love that there’s always so much to learn, lots of mini wins to celebrate, and great people to work with and share the final product with.</p>
<p>This is why code + design are my passions (Aside from ice cream.)</p>
<p>Although I now spend most the year in beautiful Boston, I am proud of my roots in Hawai'i and Hong Kong as well. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This past summer, I interned with the lovely folks at Aloha Pacific Federal Credit Union and did some freelance work. The summer before, I worked on the Smart Home Automation project at City University of Hong Kong and interned at <a href="http://fluidhk.com">fluid</a>, a creative agency in Hong Kong focusing on delivering brand/marketing solutions driven by insights and creativity. In addition to that, I have a few side projects in progress and am seeking an engaging software engineering/data mining + visualization position upon graduation anywhere in the U.S.</span></p>
