      <description>Frustrated with the inconsistency of Boston&amp;rsquo;s weather as we transitioned from Summer to Fall, I visualized the entirety of September 2015&amp;rsquo;s highs and lows every day into a compact accordion book. The comparative timeline nature of the format allows for a better overview understanding of the phenomenon experienced day in and day out in Boston.
The scale shifts from red to purple, beginning at 90+ degrees and moving down in 10-degree increments.</description>

      <title>Celebrate the Mini Wins in Life</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Celebrate the Mini Wins in Life!&amp;rdquo; is a personal mantra that I keep to remain thankful and optimistic despite the demands of everyday life. This poster is a party with vibrant colors, bold typography, and enough confetti to last all night long. Everything was hand-cut and drawn with love and care. It was an extremely time-consuming process. However, it was great fun to return to my papercraft roots and experiment organically throughout the design iterations.</description>

      <title>Begin Anywhere</title>

      <description>Begin Anywhere. A simple mantra that’s much harder to put into practice.
I decided to open myself up to a new medium/approach — A ball of coral yarn and a large blank poster board to design on. The entire piece is interconnected, with no clear indication of where the thread begins.
Another form of tactile lettering I attempted was popup lettering. I tried to play with perspective and lines with arrangement of the words to interpret the looseness that the mantra &amp;ldquo;begin anywhere&amp;rdquo; encourages.</description>

      <title>Uniting Words</title>

      <description>As a part of a workshop on Design Activism, I created a branding system for Uniting Words, an organization that promotes literacy through community storytelling initiatives. The colors, typefaces, and aesthetic convey approachableness and warmth, much like the experience of connecting with a great book or story.
There are mockups for a brand activation event that outline ideas for extending the organization&amp;rsquo;s reach through community outreach.</description>

      <title>I Never Make Time for People</title>

      <description>Since I am constantly in workaholic mode, I tend to prioritize relationships and time for friends as the last thing on my mind. I intend on changing this though, so I embarked on a month-long study of my socializing patterns.
This infographic organizes the most interesting parts of my data and conclusions formed after the experiment. It seems I do make time for people after all!</description>

      <description>True BU is one of two slates running for Student Government office in the current elections. Together with graphic designer Calvin Chinand the campaign&amp;rsquo;s communications staff, we designed a website that portrays the simple and open approach this slate offers to the BU community. We decided to let the content and platform speak for themselves.</description>

      <description>A type specimen to feature Archer&amp;rsquo;s versatility as a modern, savvy, and approachable typeface.
Slab serif fonts aren&amp;rsquo;t typically go-to options for designers, but this exploration of Archeras body text, title text, and decorative elements demonstrates all of its potential.</description>
