        <p>BU WiCS is an organization focused on fostering a sense of community and empowering students in the BU Computer Science department, with a focus on female students who have historically been significantly out-numbered in the department.</p>
<p>Prior logos for the organization emphasized the technical nature of the organization, but the board members wanted new branding that felt more inviting, more engaging, and more eye-catching.</p>
<p>The use of a monoline script BU WiCS wordmark to convey the friendliness and personal nature of the group. Condensed proportions and tight spacing give a savvy and casual feel, without being overly cute or feminine and therefore reducing the women of the group to a reductive gender presentation.</p>
<p>As for the remainder of the logo, the gathering of symbols commonly used in programming nods to the technical context of the group and bringing many different members together. Visually, it creates a patterned texture with the angular letterforms echoing the angular shapes of the symbols and an open outline and has rounded endings to represent the friendly and open nature of the group.</p>
