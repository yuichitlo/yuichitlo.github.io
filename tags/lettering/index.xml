      <description>Background Music + Us explores how we can use the lens of music and self-quantification to make data feel human in a world where big data continues to grow and data feels increasingly abstract, impersonal, and even daunting to the average individual.&#xA;The project aimed to inform audiences about data visualization history and literacy, followed by applying that understanding to music listening data collected through a survey, Billboard Hot 100 music data, and available music metadata.</description>

      <description>Background Every year, folks around the world participate in the 36 Days of Type project in the Spring and share in the love of letterforms.&#xA;Each letter is inspired by the work of an artist whose name started with the letter — It was a playground for testing out letterforms and adapting different visual styles to my own sensibilities.</description>

      <description>Process Begin Anywhere. A simple mantra that’s much harder to put into practice.&#xA;Rather than approaching the poster design on Illustrator or with ink + paper, I decided to open myself up to a new medium/approach — A ball of yarn and a large blank poster board to design on.</description>

      <description>Process Home Wiz is a local handyman business that wanted to present their company as approachable, reliable, and trustworthy.&#xA;Raf loved the idea of incorporating the shape of a house roof in the crossbar of the H, but as I explored this idea with existing typefaces, it was clear why this is not a common form in other typefaces. The ends of the roof made it difficult to space the H and o evenly and the triangular form of the roof differed so drastically in form from the remaining round shapes in the word &amp;ldquo;Home.</description>
