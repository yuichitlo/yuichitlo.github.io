      <description>&amp;ldquo;Celebrate the Mini Wins in Life!&amp;rdquo; is a personal mantra that I keep to remain thankful and optimistic despite the demands of everyday life. This poster is a party with vibrant colors, bold typography, and enough confetti to last all night long. Everything was hand-cut and drawn with love and care. It was an extremely time-consuming process. However, it was great fun to return to my papercraft roots and experiment organically throughout the design iterations.</description>

      <description>A type specimen to feature Archer&amp;rsquo;s versatility as a modern, savvy, and approachable typeface.
Slab serif fonts aren&amp;rsquo;t typically go-to options for designers, but this exploration of Archer as body text, title text, and decorative elements demonstrates all of its potential.</description>
