      <description>Background Every year, the Boston Univeristy Kilachand Honors College hosts a symposium where graduating seniors present their keystone projects across academic disciplines to the greater BU community. At the heart of the Kilachand Honors College program is the mission of fostering interdisciplinary thinking led by the heart and mind, to embody the idea of &#34;Only connect&#34; as described in E.M. Forster&#39;s Howard&#39;s End. Keystone projects ranged from analyses of operating room efficiencies to the history and influence of loanwords on the Japanese language to the impact of hegemonic masculinity on male fashion.</description>

      <description>Process &#34;Celebrate the Mini Wins in Life!&#34; is a personal mantra that I keep to remain thankful and optimistic despite the demands of everyday life. This poster is a party with vibrant colors, bold typography, and enough confetti to last all night long. Everything was hand-cut and drawn with love and care. It was an extremely time-consuming process. However, it was great fun to return to my papercraft roots and experiment organically throughout the design iterations.</description>

      <description>Background Music + Us explores how we can use the lens of music and self-quantification to make data feel human in a world where big data continues to grow and data feels increasingly abstract, impersonal, and even daunting to the average individual. The project aimed to inform audiences about data visualization history and literacy, followed by applying that understanding to music listening data collected through a survey, Billboard Hot 100 music data, and available music metadata.</description>
