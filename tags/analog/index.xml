      <description>&amp;ldquo;Celebrate the Mini Wins in Life!&amp;rdquo; is a personal mantra that I keep to remain thankful and optimistic despite the demands of everyday life. This poster is a party with vibrant colors, bold typography, and enough confetti to last all night long. Everything was hand-cut and drawn with love and care. It was an extremely time-consuming process. However, it was great fun to return to my papercraft roots and experiment organically throughout the design iterations.</description>

      <description>Begin Anywhere. A simple mantra that’s much harder to put into practice.&#xA;Rather than approaching the poster design on Illustrator or with ink + paper, I decided to open myself up to a new medium/approach — A ball of yarn and a large blank poster board to design on.</description>
